# User Graphical Human Interface

## Home Page

-   This is the Home Page that the user will see when they arrive at the website.
-   The left home page shows what the user will see when they are not logged in. The page contains information about our MoodMouse application, such as what we are, who we are, and what this project means to us.
-   The right home page is what the user will see when they log in. The page contains a friendly reminder that the survey we provide for self-assessing mood scores is not intended to diagnose any health conditions. If the user feels that they need mental health support, we encourage them to consult with their doctor or mental health professionals.

## Checkin Creation Page

-   On the create checkin page, the user can create their daily checkin, where they can:
    -   grade how happy they are from 0 to 4 for self-evaluating their feelings. 4 is the highest, and 0 is the lowest
    -   answer mood survey questions from 0 to 4. 4 is the highest, and 0 is the lowest. The survey questions are provided by our website, adn the user can use that to assess their mood, including questions like "Do they feel rested?" and "Do they feel active?
    -   respond to what they see in the Rorschach test to further assess emotional functioning for the day. A random Rorschach image can be generated by using the "generate" button

    -   answers (0-4) to each survey question, represented as a range using the meter HTML tag.
    -   responses to the Rorschach test.
    -   journal entries they have written for that day.

## Checkin Calendar Page

-   In the check-in calendar page, users can track their daily changes in well-being. When they click on a date, it will navigate them to the detail page of that daily check-in, where they can see details of their mood, journal, survey scores, and Rorschach tests. For dates where the user has not created a check-in, the color of that day will be grey, and clicking on it will not navigate them to any other pages.
-   On each date, if the user created a check-in for that day, the date will be colored on the calendar, with the color representing the total mood score. The lighter the color, the lower the mood score, and vice versa.
-   On the calendar, users can also use increment and decrement buttons to change the month they want to view. Each month will display all the check-ins they have created for that month.
-   For dates that do not belong to the current month, they are shadowed in dark grey.

Today I worked on:

Today I helped our team facilitate fine-tuning our project management workflow, which included some standarization in our git workflow by specifying set times to push, assigning people to review merge requests, etc.

I was the navigator today. Our team helped today's driver, Russ, work on
our FastAPI functions for authentication. We created AccountIn and AccountOut, AccountToken, and account with cookies classes, and we started to create query functions.

We created an environment file .env and in that file, we created an
ENV variable for our hashed password.

We got our pgAdmin page working by putting in the corresponding info in our
dockerfile.dev on the webpage on localhost:8082.

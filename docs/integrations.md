The application will need to get the following kinds of data from a third-party source:

- Type Fit Quotes (https://type.fit/api/quotes)

**Example data response:**
```
[
  {
    "text": "We can only learn to love by loving.",
    "author": "Iris Murdoch, type.fit"
  },
  {
    "text": "Self-complacency is fatal to progress.",
    "author": "Margaret Sangster, type.fit"
  },
  {
    "text": "You'll see it when you believe it.",
    "author": "Wayne Dyer, type.fit"
  },
]
```

This API does not require a key or any authentication.
